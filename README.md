FreeCAD files for a 3D printable vacuum adapter for the 3018-Pro CNC machine by RattmMotor

## Design
Comes in 4 parts:

1. Top Clamp: Clamps around the Z-Axis Assembly while allowing the spindle to move up and down and rotate. Has a vacuum hose adapter. Is fastened to the assembly using M5 screws and nuts with the screws pressing against the assembly to hold the clamp in place. Has bayonet mounting holes and slots for part 2 at the bottom.
2. Skirt Holder Top: Comes with bayonet mount pegs that screw into part 1 without tools. Clamps down on the skirt material to hold it in place.
3. Skirt Holder Bottom: Screws into Skirt Holder Top using countersunk 16mm M5 screws. Has slits for skirt material, such as sponge, plastic, or rubber flaps. The top half will clamp down on it to hold it in place.
4. Skirt: Something cheap to clamp between 2 and 3 to catch dust and debris. Just make sure it isn't long enough to catch in the tool bit or hard enough to knock your stock around.
